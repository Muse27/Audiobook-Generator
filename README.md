# Audiobook-Generator

## What is an Audiobook?
An audiobook is an audio file that is like a book. In simpler words, we can say that an audiobook is the audio version of a book.

An audiobook application takes in a book text file or pdf and converts it into an audio file and saves it in your system.

## Project Details
To build our audiobook generator, I have used the following Python libraries: Pyttsx3, PyPDF3 and tkinter. 

Tkinter will be used to create a GUI window which we will use to select our desired PDF files.

I have added 2 Buttons with Label and 2 Checkbuttons.
